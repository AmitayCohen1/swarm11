# Observatory

**System-Prompt-Driven Agent Quality Monitoring**

## What It Is

Observatory understands how your agent needs to behave based on your prompt, turns those expectations into measurable rules, and tracks how closely each response follows them.

## Problem

Teams write system prompts, but can't tell if agents actually follow them or if changes improve behavior.

## Solution

Observatory extracts behavioral rules from system prompts, scores every output against those rules, and visualizes adherence over time.

## How It Works

1. **Ingest** prompt + outputs
2. **Extract** rules from prompt
3. **Score** outputs per rule (0-10)
4. **Visualize** trends

## Value

- **Measure prompt impact** - Did that change help?
- **Catch regressions** - Are things getting worse?
- **Debug specific instructions** - Which rule is failing?

*Observatory turns prompts into rules, rules into scores, and scores into insight.*
